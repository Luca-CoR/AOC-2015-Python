# AOC-2015-Python
Hello there! <br/>
This is just me playing around with Python, so that I have something to upload onto my Git Account for people to look at, that doesn't cause me issues with copyright : ] <br/>
[AKA: My Coding at university that would be nice to look at is in Jupyter Notebooks that someone else wrote and I obviously can't put there copyrighted (probably, I mean it's their intelectual property) onto the internet, for everyone to see] <br/>
Also, here's the link to the 2015 AOC: https://adventofcode.com/2015
